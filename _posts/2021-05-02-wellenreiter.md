A quick simulation showcase running in streamlit.

We had a quick brainstorming session in which we developed this scribble:

After some iterations we came up with a demo. The demo is running at <https://shiny-simulation-system.herokuapp.com>.

The code can be found on [github](https://github.com/datadu-de/wellenreiter).

Input parameters are production amounts and sales forecasts. The result is a visual representation of the resulting stock level over the specified time frame.

It is intended for collaborative and interactive decision making in a visual way during a all-hands situation.
