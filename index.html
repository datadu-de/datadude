# Hi, I'm Frank

a marketing dude turned analytics geek, data engineer and cloud advocate. I have 10+ years in business intelligence consulting, specialising in rapid prototyping, [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), and [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/), adding [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) and [Data Lakehouse](https://databricks.com/glossary/data-lakehouse) architectures to the mix lately.

On this blog I share random data experiments, quick learnings and fascinating things I come accross on my journey.
